# My Reads.

## Overview
In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.

## App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets the user select the shelf for that book. When the user select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The search page has a text input field that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets the user add the book to their library.

## How to run the project
